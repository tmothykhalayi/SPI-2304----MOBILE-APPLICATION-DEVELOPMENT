This is a simple web application built using Express for the backend and MongoDB for the database. It allows you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a MongoDB database using a RESTful API built with Express.
**Express Setup:**
The app uses Express to set up the server and handle routing. Make sure you have Node.js installed. 

MongoDB Setup:
The app uses MongoDB as the database. If you don’t have MongoDB running locally, you can set up an account on MongoDB Atlas to use a cloud database or install MongoDB locally.

After setting up MongoDB, get the connection string and add it to your .env file.

Create a .env file:
In the root directory of the project, create a .env file and add the following environment variables:

env

MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
PORT=5000
Running the Application
Once everything is set up, run the application with the following command:
npm start
This will start the server, and it will be available at http://localhost:5000 (or the port you specified in the .env file).

API Routes
1. GET /api/items
Fetch all items from the database.
Response: A JSON array of items.
2. POST /api/items
Create a new item in the database.
Body:
json

{
  "name": "Item Name",
  "description": "Item Description"
}
3.** PUT /api/items/:id**
Update an item by ID.
Body:
json
{
  "name": "Updated Item Name",
  "description": "Updated Item Description"
}
4. DELETE /api/items/:id
Delete an item by ID.
Notes:
Express will handle routing and middleware, while MongoDB will be used to persist data.
Dependencies:
express: Web framework for Node.js.
mongoose: MongoDB ODM (Object Data Modeling) for handling database operations.
dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
Other dependencies (e.g., body-parser, cors) may be included based on your project needs.
